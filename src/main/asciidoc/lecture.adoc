== What is Redis/Valkey?

image::logo.svg[{image-20-width}]
image::valkey_logo.png[{image-20-width}]

* **Re**mote **Di**ctionary **S**erver
* In-memory key–value database
* Different kinds of abstract data structures
* Not open source since 2024 with OOS forks available, but it's a separate story...

== Popularity

== Scale of Users

Twitter, AirBnB, Tinder, Yahoo, Adobe, Hulu, Amazon...

(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redis#Users)

== What makes Redis so popular?

* Really easy to use
* Really high performant: 10000 max clients default value (compare with the default maximum for 100 for PostgreSQL)
* Swiss army knife: caches, queues, atomic counters, distributed locks, semaphores, Bloom filters, etc etc etc

* Price we pay: no ACID (only isolation) image:shrug.png[]


== So how do we test?

Testcontainers, of course!

image::testcontainers_transparent.png[{image-30-width}]

(In fact, Redis is one of the first demo examples for Testcontainers ever)

== Redis mocks in different programming languages

* Python: https://github.com/cunla/fakeredis-py
* NodeJS: https://github.com/yeahoffline/redis-mock
* **Java: https://github.com/fppt/jedis-mock**

== Why mock, if we have Testcontainers?

* Still, Testcontainers require Docker and some time to download and run the container. +
Jedis-Mock requires Java only.
* Sometimes we want to manage the reply:
** imitate a system or network failure
** give a deterministic answer for non-deterministic query

== Why mock, if we have Testcontainers?

* Sometimes we need to check the actual queries being sent

== JedisMock history

* 2017: Filipe Peliz Pinto Teixeira forked an abandoned POC repository.
* 2019: I tried to use it in my project and soon gave up
* 2021-now: actively developed by MIPT students under my supervision
* 2023: I have full rights for maintaing & publishig new versions

== JedisMock: who uses it?

* Known OSS dependents: Slack API client, dropwizard.io

image::users.png[]

== JedisMock: who uses it?

* Stable flow of incoming issues and requests.
* 170+ stars on GitHub -- please give it a star!

== Some technical details of importance

* Redis is written in C (155 KLOC of C code)

[gnuplot,loc,png]
....
set terminal png size 1000, 550  font "Helvetica,20"

$Data <<EOD
PostgreSQL   872,348
Redis        155,214
Jedis-mock    9,126
EOD

set title "Code size comparison"
set ylabel "1000s of lines of code (KLOC)"
set style data histogram
set style histogram cluster gap 1
set style fill solid border -1
set boxwidth 0.9
#set xtics rotate by -45
set yrange [0:*]
plot $Data using 2:xticlabels(1) with histogram title ""
....

== Some technical details of importance

* Redis/Valkey heavily relies on system calls and *runs on Unix-like systems only*.
* Redis/Valkey uses a single thread to process all the requests (thus isolation).


== JedisMock: the idea

== JedisMock: networking&threading

* `java.net.ServerSocket`
* Each incoming client occupies a thread in `CachedThreadPool`
* All the threads synchronize on a single lock before making changes
* Blocking operations (like `BLPOP`) use `wait`/`notify`


== So how do we make it similar to real Redis?

* Redis: 237 commands of varying popularity (Pareto 80/20 principle applies)
* Jedis-mock: 157 commands supported (66% and the number is growing)

[gnuplot,distr1,png]
....
set terminal png size 1000, 200  font "Helvetica,30"
set boxwidth 0.5 relative
set style fill solid 0.5

set yrange [0:1]
set xlabel "implemented vs not implemented"

unset key
unset xtics
unset ytics
f(x)=1

set xrange [1:237]
plot (x<=157?f(x):1/0) with boxes lc 2, (x>157?f(x):1/0) with boxes lc 7
....


== So how do we make it similar to real Redis?

* Redis: 225 commands of varying popularity (Pareto 80/20 princple applies)
* Jedis-mock: 107 commands supported (48% and the number is growing)

[gnuplot,pareto,png]
....
set terminal png size 1000, 600  font "Helvetica,30"
set boxwidth 0.5 relative
set style fill solid 0.5

set yrange [0:0.75]
set xlabel "implemented vs not implemented"
set ylabel "use cases"
unset key
unset xtics
unset ytics
f(x)=1/(x**0.6)

set xrange [1:237]
plot (x<=157?f(x):1/0) with boxes lc 2, (x>157?f(x):1/0) with boxes lc 7
....

== How do we count it?

* Redis `COMMAND` command lists all the supported commands (currently 225 of them)
* Classes annotated `@Command(<COMMAND_NAME>)` implement commands in Jedis-mock

== An automatically built fit-gap report

== What makes us sure that commands work correctly?

Comparison testing

[source,java]
----
@TestTemplate
public void whenHSettingOnTheSameKeys_EnsureReturnTypeIs1WhenKeysAreNew(Jedis jedis) {
    assertEquals(1L, jedis.hset(HASH, FIELD_1, VALUE_1));
    assertEquals(0L, jedis.hset(HASH, FIELD_1, VALUE_1));
}

Comparison testing

== Native Redis E2E tests

* Written in Tcl

[source,tcl]
----
test {INCR over 32bit value} {
    r set novar 17179869184
    r incr novar
} {17179869185}  
----

* 3932 tests in 200 Tcl scripts
* we only run a subset of them, gradually increasing the number of successful "native" tests


== Errors found by running "native" tests

[source]
----
SET  key1 stringvalue     // puts a string to key1 
HSET key2 subkey1 avalue  // puts a hashmap to key2

GET  key1                 // returns stringvalue
GET  key2                 // error: WRONGTYPE

MGET key1 key2            // ????
----

== Errors found by running "native" tests

[source]
----
LPOP  mylist     // returns the first element 
                 // or null, if the list is empty

BLPOP mylist 1   // returns the first element 
                 // or waits for it for 1 second maximum
                 
BLPOP mylist 0   // ????
----

== What next / open questions?

[%step]
* How closely a test mock should mock 'the real thing'?
* Are those "bugs" Jedis-mock problems or Redis spec problems / possible source of bad practices?
* Some day we will successfully run 100% of the tests. What happens when somebody finds a bug in Jedis-mock?

== Thanks for listening!
